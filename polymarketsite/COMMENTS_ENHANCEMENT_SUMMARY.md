# Comments Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the market detail modal comments section with threaded replies, pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Threaded Reply Display
- **Nested Comments**: Replies are now displayed as threaded conversations under their parent comments
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Replies are indented with a left border highlight (primary color) for easy identification
- **Collapse/Expand**: Each comment with replies shows a clickable button to toggle reply visibility
- **Reply Count**: Shows the number of replies on each parent comment

### 2. Pagination System
- **Load More**: Initial load shows 50 comments, with a "Load More" button to fetch additional batches
- **Incremental Loading**: Each click loads 50 more comments without losing previously loaded content
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows "Loading..." state with spinner when fetching more comments
- **End Indicator**: Displays "— End of comments —" when all comments have been loaded
- **Count Display**: Header shows "COMMENTS (loaded / total)" e.g., "(150 / 342)"

### 3. Sorting Options
Three sorting modes available:
- **RECENT**: Sorts by creation date, newest first (default)
- **OLDEST**: Sorts by creation date, oldest first
- **MOST LIKED**: Sorts by reaction count (likes), highest first

**Behavior**:
- Clicking a sort button resets the comment list and fetches from beginning
- Active sort option is highlighted with primary color
- Sort preference persists while the modal is open

### 4. Global Reply Toggle
- **Hide All Replies**: Button to collapse all reply threads at once
- **Icon-Based**: Uses MessageSquare icon for visual clarity
- **Smart Positioning**: Placed to the right of sort buttons with spacing
- **State Indication**: Button text changes between "HIDE REPLIES" and "SHOW REPLIES"
- **Disabled State**: Individual reply toggles are disabled when global hide is active
- **Tooltip**: Provides helpful context on hover

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [comments, setComments] = useState<GammaComment[]>([]);
const [commentOffset, setCommentOffset] = useState(0);
const [hasMoreComments, setHasMoreComments] = useState(true);
const [commentSortOrder, setCommentSortOrder] = useState<"recent" | "oldest" | "likes">("recent");
const [hideAllReplies, setHideAllReplies] = useState(false);
const [collapsedReplies, setCollapsedReplies] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

### Comment Organization
```typescript
const organizedComments = useMemo(() => {
  const topLevel: GammaComment[] = [];
  const repliesMap = new Map<string, GammaComment[]>();

  comments.forEach((comment) => {
    if (comment.parentCommentID) {
      // Group replies under their parent
      const parentId = comment.parentCommentID;
      if (!repliesMap.has(parentId)) {
        repliesMap.set(parentId, []);
      }
      repliesMap.get(parentId)!.push(comment);
    } else {
      // Top-level comments
      topLevel.push(comment);
    }
  });

  return { topLevel, repliesMap };
}, [comments]);
```

### API Integration
- Uses existing `gammaAPI.fetchComments()` with enhanced parameters:
  - `limit`: Always 50 for consistent batching
  - `offset`: Increments by 50 with each "Load More" click
  - `order`: Maps to "createdAt" or "reactionCount" based on sort selection
  - `ascending`: Boolean based on sort direction

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Design
- **Reply Indentation**: 2rem (8 Tailwind units) left margin for nested replies
- **Border Accent**: 2px left border in primary color for replies
- **Hover States**: All interactive elements have hover effects
- **Consistent Spacing**: 4-unit gap between UI controls

### User Flow
1. Click "SHOW COMMENTS" to open comments panel
2. Comments load with default sorting (RECENT)
3. Scroll through first 50 comments
4. Click "LOAD MORE COMMENTS" to fetch next batch
5. Use sort buttons to reorder entire comment list
6. Toggle individual reply threads or use "HIDE REPLIES" for all
7. Click profile names/avatars to view trader positions (existing feature)

### Accessibility
- Disabled states clearly indicated with opacity and cursor changes
- Tooltips on interactive elements
- Loading states prevent double-clicks
- Keyboard-friendly button controls

## Performance Considerations
- **Memoization**: Comment organization runs only when comment array changes
- **Batch Loading**: 50 comments per request prevents overwhelming the UI
- **Conditional Rendering**: Replies only render when expanded
- **Cache Utilization**: Gamma API caching (60s TTL) reduces redundant requests

## File Modified
- `polymarketsite/components/MarketDetailModal.tsx`

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies added
- Uses existing Lucide icons: `MessageSquare`, `ThumbsUp`, `User`, `Loader2`
- Leverages existing UI components: `Dialog`, `ScrollArea`, `Button` patterns

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Add ability to write/post comments
- [ ] Add ability to like/react to comments
- [ ] Implement infinite scroll instead of "Load More" button
- [ ] Add search/filter within comments
- [ ] Show notification badge for new comments
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts (j/k navigation)
- [ ] Implement comment permalinks
