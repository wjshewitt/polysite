# UI Reshaping Quick Start Guide

## What's New? 🎉

The Market Detail Modal now **intelligently reshapes** when you view comments, making better use of screen space while keeping important information accessible!

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Open any market** from the dashboard
2. **Click "SHOW COMMENTS"** button in the modal header
3. **Watch the magic happen:**
   - Modal expands to use more screen width
   - Stats grid compacts from 4 to 2 columns
   - Non-essential sections auto-collapse
   - Comments panel appears on the right
   - Important info (outcomes/prices) stays visible and sticky

### Advanced Interactions

#### Expand/Collapse Sections
When comments are visible:
- **Click any section header** to expand/collapse it
- Look for the **▼ Show** or **▲ Hide** indicators
- Auto-collapsed sections: Tags, Resolution Source, Technical Info
- Always visible: Description (truncated), Outcomes & Prices (sticky)

#### Description Truncation
- Description shows **4 lines** by default in compact mode
- **Hover over it** to see full text
- **Click the header** to fully collapse/expand

#### Return to Normal
- **Click "HIDE COMMENTS"** to close the comments panel
- All sections automatically expand back
- Layout returns to original state
- Smooth animations throughout

## Visual Cues

### Active Compact Mode
When comments are showing, you'll see:
- ✅ **Blue banner** at top: "Compact view enabled • Click section headers..."
- ✅ **Primary-colored toggle button** (instead of default gray)
- ✅ **Sticky outcomes panel** (stays at top when scrolling)
- ✅ **2-column stats grid** (instead of 4)
- ✅ **Dimmed collapsed sections** (60% opacity)
- ✅ **Right border** on main content area

### Section States
- **Expanded**: ▲ Hide (primary color)
- **Collapsed**: ▼ Show (muted color, 60% opacity)
- **Hover**: Color changes, clear clickable indication

## Tips & Tricks 💡

### Best Practices
1. **Keep outcomes visible**: The sticky panel ensures you can always see live prices while reading comments
2. **Collapse what you don't need**: Click headers to hide sections you're not interested in
3. **Hover for quick view**: Hover over truncated description to read without expanding
4. **Use the space**: Modal expands to 95% viewport width for maximum reading area

### Keyboard Navigation
- Use **Tab** to navigate between interactive elements
- **Enter** or **Space** to toggle sections
- All standard accessibility features work

### Performance
- All animations are **hardware-accelerated**
- No lag even with hundreds of comments
- Smooth 300ms transitions throughout

## Troubleshooting

### Comments button doesn't work?
- Check if market has comments (count shown in button)
- Refresh page if needed

### Sections won't collapse?
- Collapse only works when comments are visible
- Look for the compact mode banner at top
- If banner isn't there, comments aren't showing

### Layout looks weird?
- Try closing and reopening comments
- Refresh the page
- Check browser zoom (100% recommended)

### Animations are jumpy?
- Could be browser performance
- Try closing other tabs
- Animations are optimized but require modern browser

## Browser Support

✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
✅ Firefox (latest)
✅ Safari (latest)
✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Accessibility ♿

- **Keyboard navigable**: All sections can be toggled via keyboard
- **Screen readers**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color contrast**: Meets WCAG AA standards
- **Focus indicators**: Clear focus states on all interactive elements
- **Motion**: Animations use standard CSS transitions

## FAQ

**Q: Can I keep sections expanded in compact mode?**
A: Yes! Click any collapsed section header to expand it. Your choice overrides the auto-collapse.

**Q: Will my preferences be saved?**
A: Not currently. Each time you open comments, sections auto-collapse. Future enhancement planned.

**Q: Can I disable the auto-collapse?**
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. For now, just click headers to expand what you need.

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**
A: The feature works but may be tight on small screens. We recommend using on tablets or larger.

**Q: Will this slow down my browser?**
A: No! All animations are CSS-based and hardware-accelerated for optimal performance.

**Q: Can I resize the split between content and comments?**
A: Not currently. The 60/40 split is optimized for readability. May be customizable in future.
