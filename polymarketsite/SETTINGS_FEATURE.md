# Settings & Diagnostics Feature

## Overview

A dedicated Settings view has been added to the Polymarket Live Monitor, consolidating all diagnostic and configuration tools in one organized, aesthetically consistent interface.

## What Changed

### Before
- Diagnostics panels (DiagnosticsPanel, WebSocketDebug) were displayed directly on the main dashboard
- They took up valuable screen space and cluttered the main view
- No centralized location for system information or configuration

### After
- All diagnostics moved to a dedicated "Settings & Diagnostics" tab
- Main dashboard is cleaner and focused on market data
- Professional, organized settings interface with collapsible sections
- Consistent with the site's dark, monospace aesthetic

## How to Access

Navigate to the **Settings & Diagnostics** tab using:
- The main tab navigation at the top of the page

### Responsive Typography
- Base: `text-[11px]` / `text-xs`
- Small: `sm:text-xs` / `sm:text-sm`
- Large: `lg:text-base` / `lg:text-lg`
- Headers: `text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl`

### Layout Principles
- Collapsible sections to reduce visual clutter
- Important diagnostics (Connection) expanded by default
- Advanced diagnostics collapsed by default
- Full-height scrollable container
- Responsive grid layouts for information display
