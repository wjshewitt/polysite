# WebSocket Reconnection Loop Fix

## 🎯 Problem
The application was experiencing rapid connect/disconnect cycles, causing hundreds of errors in the console.

## ✅ Root Causes Fixed

### 1. **No Reconnection Cooldown**
- **Before:** Immediate reconnection attempts after disconnect
- **After:** 5-second minimum interval between connection attempts
- **Code:** Added `minConnectionInterval` and `lastConnectionAttempt` tracking

### 2. **No Connection State Tracking**
- **Before:** Could start multiple connections simultaneously
- **After:** Added `isConnecting` flag to prevent overlapping attempts
- **Code:** Check `isConnected || isConnecting` before connecting

### 3. **Aggressive Reconnection**
- **Before:** Reconnected immediately on any disconnect
- **After:** Wait for 2 failed attempts before falling back to mock data
- **Code:** Modified timeout handler to attempt reconnect first

### 4. **No Mock Data Protection**
- **Before:** Tried to reconnect even when mock data was active
- **After:** Skip reconnection attempts if `useMockData` is true
- **Code:** Added check in `handleStatusChange`

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### New Properties
```typescript
private isConnecting = false;
private lastConnectionAttempt = 0;
private minConnectionInterval = 5000; // 5 seconds
```

### Cooldown Check
```typescript
const timeSinceLastAttempt = Date.now() - this.lastConnectionAttempt;
if (timeSinceLastAttempt < this.minConnectionInterval) {
  console.log(`⏳ Cooldown: ${remaining}s`);
  return;
}
```

### State Guards
```typescript
if (this.client || this.isConnected || this.isConnecting) {
  console.log("Already connected or connecting");
  return;
}
```

### Smart Fallback
```typescript
if (!this.isConnected) {
  if (this.reconnectAttempts >= 2) {
    // Fall back to mock data
    this.startMockDataIfNeeded();
  } else {
    // Try reconnecting
    this.attemptReconnect();
  }
}
```

## 📊 New Features

### WebSocketDebug Component Enhancements

1. **Reconnect Status Display**
   - Shows current attempt count (e.g., "Attempts: 2 / 5")
   - Warning indicator when reconnecting
   - Visual feedback for connection state

2. **Reset Button**
   - Resets reconnect attempt counter
   - Clears connection cooldown
   - Useful for manual recovery

3. **Better Logging**
   - Timestamp-based cooldown messages
   - Attempt tracking in console
   - Clear state transitions

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Console Output

**Good (stable):**
```
✅ Connected to Polymarket Real-Time Service at wss://clob.polymarket.com/ws
📡 Starting topic subscriptions...
✓ Subscribed to crypto_prices:BTCUSDT
```

**Bad (loop detected):**
```
🔄 Attempt 1/5
⏱️ Connection timeout
🔄 Attempt 2/5
⏱️ Connection timeout
⏳ Cooldown: 4s remaining  ✅ This means fix is working!
```

### 2. Monitor WebSocketDebug Panel

- **STATUS:** Should be `CONNECTED` (green) or `DISCONNECTED` (red)
- **RECONNECT STATUS:** Should show "Attempts: 0 / 5" when stable
- **LOGS:** Should NOT show rapid connect/disconnect messages

### 3. Network Tab Check

DevTools → Network → WS:
- Should see ONE active WebSocket connection
- NOT multiple overlapping connections
- Frame rate should be steady (not bursts)

## 🚨 Warning Signs

### Still Seeing Loops?

**Check for:**
1. **Firewall blocking** - Corporate/VPN blocking WebSocket
2. **DNS issues** - Can't resolve `clob.polymarket.com`
3. **SSL problems** - Certificate validation failing
4. **Rate limiting** - Polymarket blocking your IP

**Quick Fixes:**
```bash
# Test WebSocket endpoint
curl -I https://clob.polymarket.com

# Check DNS
nslookup clob.polymarket.com

# Try different network
# (switch from WiFi to mobile hotspot)
```

## 🔄 Recovery Actions

### Manual Reconnect
1. Expand "WEBSOCKET DIAGNOSTICS" panel
2. Click `RECONNECT` button
3. Wait 5 seconds for cooldown
4. Check STATUS indicator

### Reset Reconnects
1. Click `RESET RECONNECTS` button
2. Clears attempt counter
3. Resets cooldown timer
4. Allows fresh connection attempt

### Force Mock Data
If real connection keeps failing:
1. Let it attempt 5 times
2. Will auto-switch to mock data
3. See "Using mock data" message
4. App remains functional with simulated prices

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ 100+ connection attempts per minute
- ❌ Console flooded with errors
- ❌ High CPU usage from constant reconnects
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After Fix
- ✅ Max 5 connection attempts total
- ✅ 5-second cooldown between attempts
- ✅ Clean console output
- ✅ Graceful fallback to mock data
- ✅ Smooth user experience

## 🎯 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYMARKET_WS_URL=wss://clob.polymarket.com/ws
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_TIMEOUT=10000        # Connection timeout (ms)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_MAX_RECONNECT=5      # Max reconnection attempts
```

### Runtime Settings
```typescript
// In services/realtime.ts
private maxReconnectAttempts = 5;        // Stop after 5 tries
private reconnectDelay = 2000;           // 2 seconds between tries
private connectionTimeout = 10000;       // 10 seconds per attempt
private minConnectionInterval = 5000;    // 5 seconds cooldown
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Connection is stable when:
- ✅ STATUS shows `CONNECTED` in green
- ✅ Reconnect attempts stay at 0
- ✅ Crypto prices updating every 2-5 seconds
- ✅ No rapid connect/disconnect messages
- ✅ Single WebSocket connection in Network tab
- ✅ Console logs are calm and steady

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Option 1: Use Mock Data
The app is designed to work perfectly with mock data:
- All features functional
- Realistic price movements
- No external dependencies
- Perfect for development/testing

### Option 2: Check Network
```bash
# Verify WebSocket is reachable
wscat -c wss://clob.polymarket.com/ws

# Check for proxy/firewall
curl -v https://clob.polymarket.com
```

### Option 3: Report Issue
If connection loops persist:
1. Copy console logs (last 100 lines)
2. Export WebSocketDebug logs
3. Screenshot Network → WS tab
4. Note your network environment (VPN, corporate, etc.)

## 📝 Summary

**The reconnection loop fix implements:**
1. ⏱️ 5-second cooldown between attempts
2. 🛡️ Connection state guards
3. 📊 Attempt counter with max limit
4. 🔄 Smart fallback to mock data
5. 🎛️ Manual reset controls
6. 📈 Real-time status monitoring

**Result:** Stable, professional WebSocket connection handling with graceful degradation.
