# 🚀 Server Ready - Testing Guide

## ✅ Server Status

**The Polymarket Live Monitor is now running!**

- **URL:** http://localhost:3001
- **Status:** ✅ ONLINE
- **Port:** 3001
- **Process:** Next.js 15.0.2 Development Server

---

## 🧪 Quick Test Checklist

### 1. **Open the Application**
```bash
# In your browser, navigate to:
http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. **Check WebSocket Connection**

**Look for in browser console:**
```
✅ Connected to Polymarket Real-Time Service at wss://clob.polymarket.com/ws
🔌 WebSocket connection established successfully
📡 Starting topic subscriptions...
✓ [1/10] Subscribed to crypto_prices:BTCUSDT
✓ [2/10] Subscribed to crypto_prices:ETHUSDT
...
✅ Successfully subscribed to 10/10 crypto symbols
```

**If you see:**
```
⏳ Cooldown: 5s remaining
```
✅ This is GOOD - the reconnection loop fix is working!

### 3. **Verify Crypto Prices**

**In the UI, you should see:**
- ✅ **Auto-scrolling ticker** at the top with live prices
- ✅ **Crypto Prices panel** with 10+ crypto cards
- ✅ **Prices updating** every 2-5 seconds

**In console, look for:**
```
💰 Update: ETHUSDT = $2345.12
🏪 Store: cryptoPrices Map now has 10 entries
```

### 4. **Check WebSocket Diagnostics**

**Expand the "WEBSOCKET DIAGNOSTICS" panel:**
- **STATUS:** Should show `CONNECTED` in green
- **CRYPTO PRICES:** Should show `10 / 10` or increasing
- **RECONNECT STATUS:** Should show `Attempts: 0 / 5`
- **ENDPOINT:** `clob.polymarket.com/ws`

### 5. **Inspect Network Tab**

**DevTools → Network → WS:**
- ✅ Should see ONE WebSocket connection
- ✅ Connection should be to `clob.polymarket.com/ws`
- ✅ Should see frames flowing (subscriptions + price updates)
- ❌ Should NOT see multiple rapid connect/disconnect

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Scenario A: Successful Connection
```
[0s]  🔌 Initializing client
[1s]  ✅ Connected
[2s]  📡 Subscriptions sent
[5s]  💰 First crypto prices received
[10s] 💰 Crypto prices updating regularly
[∞]   Stable connection, no reconnects
```

### Scenario B: Connection Issues (With Fixes Applied)
```
[0s]  🔌 Attempt 1/5
[10s] ⏱️ Connection timeout
[15s] ⏳ Cooldown: 5s remaining  ✅ FIX WORKING
[20s] 🔌 Attempt 2/5
[30s] ⏱️ Connection timeout
[35s] 🎭 Falling back to mock data  ✅ GRACEFUL FALLBACK
[36s] 💰 Mock prices generating
[∞]   App fully functional with mock data
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Waiting for crypto prices..."

**Possible Causes:**
1. WebSocket not connected
2. Subscriptions not sent
3. Polymarket API down

**Check:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
const store = window.__NEXT_DATA__ || {};
// Look for crypto price data
```

**Fix:**
1. Expand WebSocket Diagnostics panel
2. Check STATUS (should be CONNECTED)
3. Click RECONNECT button if needed
4. If fails repeatedly, app will use mock data

### Issue: Rapid Connect/Disconnect Loop

**This should be FIXED now, but if you still see it:**

**Check console for:**
```
⏳ Cooldown: 4s remaining  ✅ Fix is active
```

**If cooldown NOT showing:**
1. Refresh the page completely
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check that `services/realtime.ts` has the fix
4. Click `RESET RECONNECTS` in diagnostics panel

### Issue: No Data After Connection

**Verify subscriptions were sent:**
```
✓ [1/10] Subscribed to crypto_prices:BTCUSDT
✓ [2/10] Subscribed to crypto_prices:ETHUSDT
...
```

**If not seeing these:**
1. Check `subscribeToTopics()` in `services/realtime.ts`
2. Verify filters are JSON.stringify({ symbol })
3. Check topic is "crypto_prices" and type is "update"

### Issue: Mock Data Active

**You'll see:**
```
🎭 Starting mock data generator as fallback...
Using mock data - WebSocket unavailable
```

**This is OK!** Mock data provides:
- ✅ Realistic crypto prices
- ✅ All features functional
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Perfect for development

**To force real connection:**
1. Click `RECONNECT` in diagnostics
2. Click `RESET RECONNECTS` to clear counter
3. Wait for 5-second cooldown
4. Connection will retry

## 🎛️ Control Panel (WebSocket Diagnostics)

### Available Actions

**RECONNECT Button:**
- Manually trigger reconnection
- Resets attempt counter
- Waits 5 seconds then connects

**RESET RECONNECTS Button:**
- Clears reconnection attempt counter
- Resets cooldown timer
- Allows fresh connection attempt

**CLEAR LOGS Button:**
- Clears connection log history
- Useful for debugging fresh state

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### What's Normal?

**Connection:**
- Initial connection: < 2 seconds
- Subscription time: < 1 second
- First price: < 5 seconds

**Updates:**
- Crypto prices: Every 2-5 seconds
- Trade feed: Real-time (< 1 second)
- Market data: Every 5-30 seconds

**Resource Usage:**
- CPU: < 5% idle, < 15% active
- Memory: ~200MB
- Network: ~10KB/s average

### What's Abnormal?

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Multiple WebSocket connections
- ❌ Rapid connect/disconnect (loop)
- ❌ No price updates after 30 seconds
- ❌ CPU > 50% sustained
- ❌ Memory > 500MB

**If you see these, check:**
1. WebSocket Diagnostics panel
2. Browser console for errors
3. Network tab for connection issues
4. Click RESET RECONNECTS

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Console Commands

```javascript
// Check store state
const { usePolymarketStore } = require('@/store/usePolymarketStore');
const state = usePolymarketStore.getState();
console.log('Crypto Prices:', state.cryptoPrices.size);
console.log('Connected:', state.connected);
console.log('Trades:', state.trades.length);

// Check reconnection status
console.log('Reconnect Attempts:', realtimeService.getReconnectAttempts());
console.log('Mock Mode:', realtimeService.isMockDataMode());
```
